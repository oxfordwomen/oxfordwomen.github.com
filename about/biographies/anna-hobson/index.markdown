# Anna Hobson, Programme Coordinator

My Mum was very involved in the CND (Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) and passionate about the Women’s Movement, equality and human rights. She has inspired me to want to contribute something positive to the community. After 10 years working in the care industry, I moved to Oxford in 2009 and I am now working as an administrator for the University.

I wanted to become involved in a local project, and found myself volunteering to be Programme Coordinator for OIWF. The process of planning for the 2011 festival was an amazing experience: exhausting and frustrating at times, but I have met some incredible women and have been a part of some wonderful events in Oxford.  What I love about OIWF is the passion and commitment to promoting and celebrating women’s achievements, the wide-reaching inclusivity of the festival, and feeling a part of the community.  I have learnt so much about the strength of women, and learnt a lot about myself along the way. Roll on next year!
