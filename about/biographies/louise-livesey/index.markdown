Louise is many things: activist, academic, author (she also can use other letters of the alphabet in her descriptions too!). Has most recently been involved in the Women’s Festival as well as Oxford Sexual Abuse and Rape Crisis Centre, Oxford International Women’s Festival, Oxford Reclaim the Night and the Oxford Feminist Network.  She has in the past worked with Feminist Library, London Feminist Network, London 3rd Wave and been a regular writer for [The F Word](www.thefword.org.uk).  For her day job she works at Ruskin College, Oxford where she is Programme Co-ordinator for Women’s Studies (amongst other things).
