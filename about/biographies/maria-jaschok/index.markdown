# Maria Jaschok, IGS director, Lady Margaret Hall, U. of Oxford.

I am German-born, English-educated and stem from a matriline of strong, feminist women. My earliest role models were Rosa Luxembourg and Alexandra Kollontai, combining for me essential qualities of courage, creativity, intelligence and a necessary dosage of flamboyance. I took my interest in feminist enquiry into my academic career. Specialised in Modern Chinese history, sociology and anthropology, my research interests have reflected certain long-standing priorities of mine: how to facilitate women's coming to voice, how to render the invisible life experiences of women visible, and how to most effectively testify to  women's  ideals, aspirations and persistent demands for more just and fair choices for all.

Since assuming the directorship of the International Gender Studies Centre (until September 2011, located at QEH; from September 2011 onwards, located at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford), I have actively sought IGS involvement in the annual OIWF events. Together with colleagues at IGS (Dr. Janette Davies and Dr. Jackie Waldren), I have determined that one of the oldest women/gender studies centres in the country must constitute an integral part of Oxford's unique celebration of women's diverse and global community. Since 2000, we have not only contributed to the Festival, I have also ensured that IGS is represented on the Committee, helping to shape decisions and support the Festival in practical as well as conceptual ways.

The impact of the Festival can be ascertained from the great numbers of women attending our Programme events. Publicity through radio talkshows and TV interviews have also helped to widen the impact, leading to discussions over the origins and history of the Festival and also to necessary debates over the changes as well as continuities of issues confronting women in the twenty-first century.

What I enjoy most of all is the opportunity to bring women from different backgrounds together in order to work for a common cause. Whatever the challenges - and these are numerous - the enthusiasm and idealism engendered by the group of women I got to know can be most infectious. Oxford can lead easily to segregated lives - and it requires such a cause as offered by the Festival to come together, reminding ourselves of the strength women collectively can generate.

From a German background, the important role played by the German socialist Clara Zetkin in calling for an international women's day to celebrate the solidarity of women worldwide was well-known to me. But having been brought up in what was then West Germany, the marking of International Women's Day was considered a thing that East German women (i.e. from the Socialist Germany) were wont to indulge in. For us, that is, pupils at a West German convent school, something quite different was marked: Mother's Day. That was the appropriate celebration for young girls from the 'free' West to indulge in! I have never forgotten the 'othering' of the great women revolutionaries on the part of the West German political establishment. But it took many years to allow me to take part in events which both reference the radical origins and ancestresses of the International Women's Day and moreover celebrate the ingenuity and creativity as well as stubborn determination of their many and varied descendants.
