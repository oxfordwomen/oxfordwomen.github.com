#Kate Clayton-Hathaway, festival secretary

I’ve been involved in campaigning for human rights for over 20 years, and became involved in OIWF as coordinator for the Oxford Amnesty International Stop Violence Against Women campaign. I loved the idea of diverse groups of women getting together to plan community events, and enjoyed meeting women from different backgrounds and learning from their experiences.

As a tutor in the Widening Participation section of the Open University, I know only too well the barriers which many groups of women face to achieving their life goals and aspirations. I feel the Women’s Festival helps us share expertise and understanding, and have seen some wonderful teamwork in operation.  From organising individual Festival events, I moved on to the committee in 2011 and have helped involve community groups and with some much needed fund-raising. As Festival Secretary for 2012, I hope to put my organisational skills to good use!
