# Andie Berryman, Website Maintenance

I maintain this website and built it in conjunction with [Gubha](http://gubha.com). I am currently an MA women's studies student at Ruskin College, Oxford and can be found contributing to a number of events/charities that promote the end of violence towards women. I am currently co-ordinating a project that will set up a Womens centre in Oxford.

Andie can be contacted at: [andrea.berryman@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:andrea.berryman@yahoo.co.uk)
